Thank you for installing my mod! It means a lot to me.

For the config.json settings, there is currently one setting, although by checking the content.json you will see there is other unimplemented configs.

so far, the only setting is seasonal.
false: Shouko will have the same outfit consistently
true: Shouko's outfit will only change with the season, for a total of 4 outfits.
Advanced: Currently unimplemented. Hopefully will give Shouko a seasonal outfit on par with Seasonal Villager OUtfits.

I have more options waiting to be implemented. THe biggest of which will make the storyline of Shouko either lore-friendly, or canon-friendly.
Lore-friendly will aim to have Shouko molded for the Stardew Valley lore. Other characters from A Silent Voice do not exist and are not present.
Canon-friendly will make SHouko still stay with the lore of A Silent Voice.

You may notice that the Shouko NPC mod is acually bundled into 6 mods. Most of these are currently unimplemented. and are planned for future content.

If you have any questions, feel free to message me on discord on the Stardew Valley server or a DM.
